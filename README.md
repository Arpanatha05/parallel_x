Overview: Med reminders, family check-ins.
Description: Rahul s grandfather, who lives with him, often forgets to take his medicines on time. Despite
Rahul s best efforts, his busy schedule makes it difficult to keep track of his grandfather s daily health
routines. Missed medications or appointments can lead to serious health issues and added stress for the
whole family. Rahul needs a simple, reliable solution that reminds his grandfather about his medications and
appointments - while also keeping Rahul informed. A smart system is needed to support elderly care through
timely reminders, health tracking, and caregiver alerts, helping families like Rahul s ensure better care with
peace of mind.
